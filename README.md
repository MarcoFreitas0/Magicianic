Hey, I'm Marco Freitas AKA Magicianic. I've almost all my Master's in Finance course complete, however got stuck on thesis.
I'm here to start learning and deposit project in data science since I believe that it and my academic background mixes well.

If anyone have suggestions for initial projects to practice my codding, I'm always here.

Hope to team up with you soon.
